\/>\n\t\t<\/div>\n<p><strong>The first time<\/strong> I was asked to build a Bugatti I said: &#8216;Sure \u2013 it&#8217;s just a car, how hard can it be?&#8217;<\/p>\n<p>That turned out to be one of the most stupid things I have ever said. The Bugatti was a Type 59 3.3-liter Grand Prix car and I had little more than half the original parts. It proved to be quite an education, not only in the complexity, elegance and sometimes stupidity of Bugatti engineering, but in the politics of highly valued cars too. That project took about three years and the result was agonizingly beautiful. It was also the bane of my existence.<\/p>\n<p>With the Type 59 GP parts came an original Type 57 chassis with the correct engine, transmission, rear axle and most of the original mechanical components. The only major component missing was the front axle, although the axle stubs, brakes, steering and suspension parts were in place.<\/p>\n<p>The chassis turned out to be pretty special on its own: chassis no 57104, the fourth Type 57 produced, appears to be the oldest still in existence. I have heard rumors that an earlier chassis is still out there but I have not yet been able to find it, or even documentation to support the rumors.<\/p>\n<p>Chassis 57104 was originally delivered to Lamberjack, a Parisian dealership, in 1934. It was probably bodied as a drophead by Van Vooren and then went through a string of owners. It appears to have lost its coachwork during the Second World War or shortly after and a replacement body was never mounted but the chassis and mechanicals remained a cohesive flock of parts.<\/p>\n<p>Post-war and without coachwork it went through another string of owners and was eventually purchased by Tom Barrett, co-founder of the Barrett-Jackson auction house. He wanted to put an Atlantic body on it and to that end it was sent to Bugatti restorer Ray Jones. Jones replaced 57104 with an SC chassis replica which was correct for the Atlantic; the standard 57104 chassis was deemed surplus. I acquired it in the mid-1990s and was tempted to restore it as a fully running chassis, but then what do you do with it?<\/p>\n<p>I began poring through books for inspiration. My focus had been on racing cars but my heart found a home as I became aware of some of the dramatic Bugatti road cars produced during the 1930s. One page became increasingly dog-eared. I kept straying back to pictures of Jean Bugatti\u2019s masterpiece, the Aerolithe.<\/p>\n<p>My original partner on the Type 59 had no interest in building another Bugatti (he used to say some very uncomplimentary things about Bugattis, usually while he was signing another check) so I tendered the project. I had numerous replies and some very serious interest, including a certain Nicolas Cage of California. Despite his own best intentions a couple of years went by and nothing happened, and then I got a phone call from another gentleman who was interested in the project.<\/p>\n<p>Not a Hollywood A-lister this time, nor a car buff. He was, however, an art aficionado with strong ties to the world of architectural restoration, and was familiar with how inexact that science can be. His greatest passions extended to the saving and preservation of historical monuments and buildings around the world, a passion that still seems in no danger of abating.<\/p>\n<p>He was perhaps the best possible patron for this task. He wanted us scrupulously to adhere to the crafts and methods of the 1930s and for the star of the 1935 Paris auto show car to be recreated with no modern liberties taken. Our shared vision ensured that we would be as faithful to the original Aerolithe as it appeared on the Bugatti stand at the Palais Royale as was humanly possible. With those rules established we set about the task of building the crown jewel of Bugatti\u2019s 1935 salon collection.<\/p>\n<p>Very little of the enormous research involved centred on the Aerolithe itself. There are only about 11 meaningful photographs of the car and no specifically Aerolithe blueprints or plans, aside from that of the radiator and another of a foot pedal. These, according to the Bugatti Trust at the time, were all that survived. What writings exist are sketchy, many are contradictory, and some older essays have been the subject of prejudicial editing over time, especially in the last decade or so.<\/p>\n<p>One thing we did know. When Ettore Bugatti came under fire from critics for the spinelike fins that ran along the wings and centerline of the car, he stated that the coachwork had been made from a new wonder metal called Elektron. As it could not be welded, the fins allowed the major sections to be riveted together. Elektron is a magnesium alloy consisting of around 97% magnesium, with the remainder aluminium. The press dubbed the car the Elektron Coupe.<\/p>\n<p>It was decided even before the project started that to create the Aerolithe coachwork in anything but magnesium would be inexcusable. That decision made life difficult and costly over the next six years.<\/p>\n<p>Magnesium is hard and light: its only two redeeming qualities. It is also brittle, almost unbendable, and dangerously flammable. If that weren\u2019t enough our bodies absorb it in great quantities, which can lead to uncomfortable symptoms. The solution is to dress like a spaceman, especially when welding, heating or cutting it. The solutions to the other problems are a little more difficult.<\/p>\n<p>When you bend it, if it doesn\u2019t crack it will soon be reassuming its original shape. When we first bought the 8ft by 4ft sheets we were told it could not be hand-formed or bent on the English wheel, especially into the tight compound curves we required. The manufacturers advised us to cast the shapes, but this was not an option; we had to find a way to shape it by hand.<\/p>\n<p>We discovered that if we heated the material to around 850\u00baF it became plastic enough for us to shape on the wheel, but at around 1150\u00baF it starts to burn. Suffice it to say that specialized fire extinguishers were at hand.<\/p>\n<p>Once an apprentice unfamiliar with the material thought he would help out by grabbing a burning bit before the welder could get his helmet off. With the sputtering magnesium part in hand he raced across the shop with my welder in hot pursuit, carrying the extinguisher and yelling at the top of his lungs. With a gasp of relief the apprentice hurled the flaming torch (moments before, it had been a headlight pot) into the sink and turned the water on full. The result was an odd explosion that saw the entire shop waist-deep in a seething cloud of magnesium fog followed by a mass exodus of all staff. It looked like a Hollywood horror film set. All employees were then trained fully in the vagaries of magnesium handling.<\/p>\n<p>After months of trial and error the material was finally mastered and the build began in earnest. The chassis itself was so complete that it was a very easy process to restore it, even to the high level that I demanded of my staff. We knew that the Aerolithe\u2019s engine was a basic non-supercharged 3.3-liter straight-eight that, in order to allow for a lower hood profile, had been moved about 90mm rearwards from the standard position of the radiator hovering over the front axle. This meant the radiator and cowl could be positioned behind and lower than the front axle, something quite visible in pictures of the Paris show car. Apart from a need to create two new rear engine mounts the job was accomplished with no fuss. But then some discoveries put us in hot water with members of the old guard.<\/p>\n<p>We told all concerned that we really did not care what the chassis of the original car was, as we were building the non-supercharged shortened-standard-chassis number 57104 and mounting Aerolithe-style coachwork on it. The actual Aerolithe became one of the great automotive mysteries after it disappeared sometime after a visit to England in 1936. I have always harbored the suspicion that, as an ageing and useless design prototype, it was probably torn down for its valuable mechanical bits and pieces at the factory, which was financially stressed at the time.<\/p>\n<p>The common understanding, which I shared until I built the car, was that the Aerolithe, while not supercharged, sat on an S chassis, the one common to all three Atlantics for which the Aerolithe was the prototype. Some go so far as to maintain that the car was built on a T57 S gondola chassis, which curved to a point at the back. That chassis was built to accommodate a car that resembled a T59 GP car called the T57 Torpedo TT, which was being built at the same time. We checked this theory very closely, as its supporters were strident, and came to the conclusion that the coupe\u2019s body would not sit on a gondola chassis and allow space for the fuel tank and spare tire, nor would the steering box require the clearly photographed bulge in the coachwork that was dictated by a standard chassis. It would have also needed some very odd outriggers to support the coachwork at the rear, which were totally impractical.<\/p>\n<p>What we found was that a lot of armchair theories were not viable in the real world of building a car, either now or in 1935. In fact the Aerolithe coachwork sits very comfortably on a shortened standard chassis with virtually no modifications. An S chassis would have called for an unlikely amount of unnecessary engineering. The last coffin nail, I believe, is that the SC chassis was not developed until the Aerolithe was almost complete. It would have taken the coachbuilders months to wrangle the magnesium alloy into the Aerolithe and I am sure they would not have dismounted the exhibition coachwork to plonk it onto a brand new chassis that was not featured anywhere on the 1935 Paris Salon Bugatti stand.<\/p>\n<p>The storm of controversy that these discoveries created was mystifying, as we were not trying to prove anything but rather just reporting what we were finding.<\/p>\n<p>Another point of contention was our choice of color for the car. Along with everyone else I had always assumed that the car was silver. Mind you, in those days, silver was the German national racing color. Once, at a concours where I was displaying the T59, I spoke to an elderly Frenchman who had served his apprenticeship with Bugatti. We chatted through an interpreter and I told him my next project might be the Aerolithe recreation. He recalled sweeping up around the car and that it was codenamed Creme de Menthe.<\/p>\n<p>A couple of years later I came across a 1936 painting by one of Bugatti\u2019s designers that was given to Jean Bugatti as a gift. In it the Aerolithe is represented flying down a springtime road surrounded by fields of flowers and blossoming trees. The color? A delightful green, like a mixed creme de menthe.<\/p>\n<p>It would be hard to believe that the painter would present this painting to the car\u2019s creator in the wrong color, so I tested it by taking a photo of a bent spray-out and transferred it to black-and-white. It looks exactly like the color in those photos taken back in 1935.<\/p>\n<p>A major feature of the Aerolithe and all the cars on the 1935 stand were the two-sided whitewall tires, unusual in Europe. We tried to find a set, as to create the car and not have the right tires on it would have driven me crazy. The only solution was to make them.<\/p>\n<p>After a month\u2019s pursuit of Goodrich and Goodyear (who share the old Dunlop rights) we finally got permission to recreate the tires with the same markings, lettering and script. All the markings were created in white rubber for application on the tires; Goodyear had insisted that only vintage-style Dunlops be used, so we had to get the correct size and have the white area carved out on both sides so that the whitewall could be vulcanized and the markings and lettering then vulcanized in place. Recently I bought a Delahaye from Spain and it had one original series-90 Dunlop blackwall on it. When we compared our markings to the originals on the blackwall we were absolutely exact. It was quite an accomplishment for our project leader, who spent almost a year on the tires and did all the scaling and template cutting.<\/p>\n<p>Now the project is winding down and the car&#8217;s future is being mapped out. To my delight, the reception we\u2019re getting is absolutely wonderful. The car is one of the main stories in the first season of a major TV series being shot at my premises and we are entertaining requests to exhibit it from museums all over the world. It has been an idea, an obsession, a business proposition, a controversy, a headache, a constant irritant and finally a magnificent cooperative work of art that I have had the pleasure and honor of building with a team of gifted individuals.<\/p>\n<p>I had no idea when I was staring at those grainy black-and-white photographs so many years ago that this day would be so long coming or, indeed, if it ever would. Looking back there is very little I would change; even the disasters were sort of fun and I love nothing better than a good fight. The car itself, I expect, will outlast me and, while I have my name on more than 1000 restorations so far, I think this is one I will remember as a high point.<\/p>\n<p>The realization of what had been accomplished didn\u2019t sink in until recently. We were in the middle of a photo shoot with the Bugatti, and the photographer, who was also the director of the pilot for our TV series, walked around the car in some wonderment, then turned to me and said: &#8216;You made this.&#8217;<\/p>\n<p>Yeah, I guess I did.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Thanks to<\/strong> The Guild of Autmotive Restorers.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"citation_text\" data-citation-text-id=\"1427688496_5518cc3033ae73.39761590\">&#8220;Recreating The 1937 Bugatti Aerolithe.&#8221; <i>AutoTraderClassics.com<\/i>.

Of those you\u2019d file under \u2018dictator\u2019 or \u2018world leader\u2019, you can add Nicolae Ceau\u015fescu, Josip Broz Tito, Fidel Castro, Saddam Hussein, FW de Klerk, \u0389amon de Valera, Pol Pot and Enver Hoxha. You can also include Leonid Brezhnev, Kim Il-sung, Kim Jong-il, noted Citroen SM fan Idi Amin and former Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos. We\u2019ll leave you to decide who from this roll call drops into which category of \u2018famed\u2019 owner.<\/p>\n<p>Finding a 600 Pullman that\u2019s not been owned by someone of note must be quite difficult, given that a mere 2,677 of these fabulously expensive cars were built between 1963 and 1981. We\u2019re in Kuwait to drive one of only two complete, running 600s in the Kingdom, an automobile which you\u2019ll not be surprised to learn has an interesting ownership history. And that\u2019s not counting its current owner, Ahmad J Al-Qathiby \u2013 a man with a penchant for classic European limousines.<\/p>\n<p>When it was first unveiled at the Frankfurt International Motor Show in 1963, the Mercedes-Benz 600 \u2013 or W100 Grosser Mercedes in Benz-speak \u2013 was an impressive statement of intent from its maker. The long-awaited successor to the immense pre-war 540K, it was intended to be simply the best car in the world \u2013 and work started on the project back in 1955.<\/p>\n<p>The team put together to style the Mercedes-Benz flagship was headed by Paul Bracq and Bruno Sacco (who would subsequently be responsible for the company\u2019s finest automobiles). Meanwhile, Dr Fritz Nallinger and his crew \u2013 Rudolf Uhlenhaut, Josef Muller and Karl Wilfert \u2013 were tasked with engineering a car that bore the weight of West Germany\u2019s expectations. The team was not encumbered by any form of development budget restrictions, and consequently created a clean-sheet design. The most exciting aspect of the 600 was its engine, dubbed the M-100. It was the company\u2019s first V8, a 6329cc powerhouse bristling with all the latest technology \u2013 sodium-filled valves, hardened valve seats and aluminium alloy cylinder heads. It developed 250bhp and 369lb ft, which were enough to push the 2,640kg limousine to a top speed of more than 125mph.<\/p>\n<p>But it was the high standard equipment tally and bespoke nature of its build that really set the 600 apart. Hydraulics powered just about everything \u2013 including the suspension, windows, seats, glass partition, door locks, trunk lid, sunroof, disc brakes and doors. This set-up was chosen by Nallinger because of its silence and smoothness \u2013 much to the chagrin of later owners who had the prospect of fixing leaky systems.<\/p>\n<p>There were several body variations, too. The 600 was offered in standard-wheelbase four-door form, as well as four- or six-door Pullman, and a Landaulet version (note the German spelling of Landaulette), favored by the less-than-shy plutocrats. Our Pullman, chassis number 2,029, is a long-wheelbase four-door, of which 428 were made \u2013 and this one has done rather a lot of travelling in its long life.<\/p>\n<p>In 1971, our car was delivered to its first owner, the Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China. It was to become the personal car of Marshal Lin Biao, at one time among the most trusted of Mao Tse-Tung\u2019s Generals. He would end up enjoying the sybaritic pleasures of this most un-Communist of cars for a tragically short period of time: Lin died on 13 September 1971, when the aeroplane in which he and his family were flying crashed in deepest Mongolia. It was flying low to evade radar, on its way to Soviet Russia, allegedly after his assassination attempt on Mao failed.<\/p>\n<p>Following the \u2018Lin Biao incident\u2019, the car was placed into storage. As Lin was an officially condemned traitor of the Communist Party of China, the continued use of his Mercedes-Benz was no longer appropriate. And the 600 remained this way until 1986, when it was pressed back into use for Prince Sihanouk, head of the Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea.<\/p>\n<p>It didn\u2019t last long in this role either, and was soon on its travels again \u2013 this time to the USA, where it was bought by Dr Armand Hammer, American industrialist and the former Chairman and CEO of the Occidental Petroleum Corporation. He had the 600 restored to concours condition (good enough to pick up a Judges\u2019 Award at the 1989 Amelia Island Concours, where it proudly wore the stars and stripes on its bumper-mounted flagpoles), before using it as his personal car. Again it proved a short-lived relationship, as Hammer died in 1990.<\/p>\n<p>Our car has been in Kuwait since the mid-1990s and, wearing a mere 32,000km on the clock, it remains in rude health despite the difficulties in getting parts there. It\u2019s clearly cherished by its wealthy owner, as it\u2019s lacking the coat of sand every other automobile in the Kingdom seems to be wearing. That makes his offer to lend us the 600 all the more generous.<\/p>\n<p>My plan is to drive the Sheikh\u2019s personal assistant around Kuwait, and see how it feels to be a chauffeur in the world\u2019s finest limousine. But because of my large feet and long legs, the cramped driving compartment is far too uncomfortable \u2013 even if it is a sight to behold, lined as it is in gorgeous rosewood and red leather. The rear looks even more inviting so, turning an irritating set-back into an opportunity, and in the interests of giving readers a true feel for life with the 600, I join our host in the back and summon his driver to give us the full guided tour of the tiny oil state.<\/p>\n<p>Typically, thanks to wide-opening doors the rear is easy to get in and out of in a most dignified way \u2013 and despite the fact the seats are set so far back, you slip round easily and almost flop into the softly-sprung bench. Once settled in, legs outstretched, feet buried in the deep-pile carpet, it\u2019s tempting to fiddle with the built-in old-school CRT television and VHS, while seeing what\u2019s in the drinks cabinet (non-alcoholic, as Kuwait is a dry state). But we\u2019re here to evaluate the 600\u2019s strengths, not play with the gadgets.<\/p>\n<p>Our driver fires up the V8 and, from where I\u2019m sitting, the noise levels don\u2019t change at all. I\u2019m aware the engine is idling, but I can\u2019t actually hear it. Yes, it\u2019s quiet, but our host is already hammering away on a superbly paced and loud business call. He\u2019s not using one of the two magnificent corded hand-sets built into the business-unit-video-player-drinks-cabinet, though, but a slimline smartphone that seems totally out of keeping with our surroundings. With nary a shudder, our driver engages gear and drifts effortlessly into the traffic \u2013 and I can immediately see the appeal of the 600 from where I\u2019m sitting. After a busy day running a country, or counting your millions (or billions), this is the perfect place to get away from it all, and watch the scenery outside silently scroll past through the curtained side-windows.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s hardly a surprise that the 600 cushions rear passengers from the realities of pot-holed urban blacktop like no other car I\u2019ve experienced. The seats are typical Mercedes-Benz items from this era \u2013 firm to the touch, but yielding and well sprung. Combine this with air-suspension, 80-profile tires, a 3.20m (126in) wheelbase and that hefty curbweight, and you have all the ingredients needed to obliterate any sensation from the road below.<\/p>\n<p>We smoothly halt for a major junction, and I figure it\u2019s time to road test some of the 600\u2019s finer features. We\u2019re already aware that the air-conditioning is working well, easily fending off the heat of the Kuwaiti evening, but it\u2019s time to exercise those much-vaunted hydraulic window controls \u2013 and true to Mercedes-Benz engineer Nallinger\u2019s wishes, they glide up and down silently and effortlessly. It\u2019s quite a contrast to our guide, who has by now conducted several deals while we\u2019ve been hustling through rush-hour traffic.<\/p>\n<p>I ask how he finds running a car like this in the Middle East. \u2018We do have some trouble getting parts, as many specialists won\u2019t deliver here,\u2019 he says. \u2018Our local Mercedes-Benz dealer is also unwilling to service the 600.\u2019 But otherwise, running the car here is as painless as it\u2019s ever going to be. Gasoline is cheap so an 8mpg thirst is no problem, and in city traffic dominated by super-sized SUVs it\u2019s actually not that unmanageable.<\/p>\n<p>At this moment the lights change, and our driver puts his foot down. For a car with no pretensions of performance, it accelerates really well. And somewhat surprisingly we\u2019re not thrown around the cabin, as there\u2019s little of the suspension squat I\u2019d been expecting. But I\u2019m forgetting that the 600 was always going to need a fair bit of agility \u2013 hence the limited-slip diff \u2013 to evade possible terrorist threats (or insistent paparazzi).<\/p>\n<p>This truly is a car defined by its buyers \u2013 interesting bunch that they are \u2013 and it meets their unique demands perfectly. We\u2019ve been afforded an insight into the lives of the rich and (in)famous, and can\u2019t help but like what we see. You can, too, as the Merc is for sale for around $165,000 (45,000 Kuwaiti dinar). The world would be a poorer place without cars like the 600 Pullman.<\/p>\n<p>1971 Mercedes-Benz 600 Pullman<\/p>\n<p>Engine 6329cc all-alloy V8, SOHC, two valves per cylinder, Bosch D-Jetronic mechanical fuel injection<br \/>\nPower 250bhp @ 4000rpm<br \/>\nTorque 369lb ft @ 2800rpm<br \/>\nTransmission Four-speed auto, limited-slip diff<br \/>\nSteering Recirculating ball, power-assisted<br \/>\nSuspension Self-levelling air-suspension, adjustable damping, torsion bar stabilisers, rear swing-axle<br \/>\nBrakes Discs all round, servo-assisted<br \/>\nWeight 2640kg Performance<br \/>\nTop speed 125mph; 0-60mph 9.0sec<\/p>\n<p> &#8220;Driven: 1971 Mercedes-Benz 600 Pullman.&#8221; AutoTraderClassics.com.
