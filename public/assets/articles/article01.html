    <h3 class='op-kicker'>Pulled Over by the Coolest COP EVER!!!</h3>
</header>
<p> While on his way to work this biker wanted to show off a bit in front of a Mustang he passed on the highway. While he’s speeding up a bit he fails to see a cop behind him catching him dead to rights on speeding. The biker even admits he had no excuse for driving that fast and was simply caught up in the moment and acting stupid. The cop runs his details and is surprised to find out he doesn’t have any previous violations or speeding tickets. He then tells the biker he’s not going to give him a ticket but asks if he’ll turn off his camera so he can ask him something unrelated. What he asks him is whether or not he knows about some of the larger biker groups that have been terrorizing the streets and highways. You can’t fault the cop for trying to get some inside info!</p>
